tutorial 1 - assingment using integer values
tutorial 3 - assignment using float values

integer kernel run time is less (however that kernel is only called once, whereas the float kernel is called several times)
integer memeory transfer time is less (most output buffers/vectors only one value)


Test Values:
floats - 
AVG kernel time: 1.1 x e^6		AVG mem time: 1.3 x e^6
MAX kernel time: 1.1 x e^6 		MAX mem time: 1 x e^6
MIN kernel time: 1.1 x e^6 		MAX mem time: 1 x e^6
STANDDEV kernel time: 1.1 x e^6		STANDDEV mem time: 1.2 x e^6


ints - 
AVG kernel time: 3.2 x e^5		AVG mem time: 1440
MAX kernel time: 3.5 x e^5		MAX mem time: 1280
MIN kernel time: 3.5 x e^5		MIN mem time: 992
STANDDEV kernel time: 3.4 x e^6		STANDDEV mem time: 832
